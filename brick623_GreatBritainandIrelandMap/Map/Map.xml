	<!-- Real City Naming. You have to fill this in manually -->
	<!--
		* CityLocaleName must have a matching entry in MapText.xml
		* Area is by default 1 (i.e. a radius of 1, i.e. one center tile and six surrounding tiles.
		  A radius of 2 adds yet another 12 surrounding tiles. A radius of 0 is only 1 tile)
		* Civilization should only have a value if a name applies to only one civ. I.e. a tile can
		  have multiple entries for different civs, such as "London" as a standard value for London,
		  but "Londres" for France or "Londinium" for Rome
